I am offering these files and information on the World-Wide Web, under the MIT license below, as well as the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), because I want to, but they belong to me and are my intellectual property. 
By being my intellectual property, they are also covered by the institutions who contractually own any intellectual property of mine -- namely, Ulster University. 
Therefore, Ulster University has overarching rights over this work and its products; legal stuff should thus be dealt with them directly. 
The jurisdiction for legal stuff is based where I live and work and where Ulster University is based, viz. Northern Ireland. 
I only authorise the use of these files and information for scientific purposes and with open access to anything related to it. 
No other use is allowed, in particular for commercial purposes or those whereby full access is not publicly available. 
Some pieces of code were deeply based on information publicly available online, on forums easily found on Google. So, if you copy my code, you are, to some extent, also using these sources. Therefore, any consequence regarding this is your responsibility. 
All that is being offered here (code, information, resources) is offered under absolutely no warranty. Your use of this code is your responsibility. I do not guarantee anything relative to this product. I have no commitment, whether financial, commercial, or legal, to users' use of the code I developed. Please, find the license below.
