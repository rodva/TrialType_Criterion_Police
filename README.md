# TrialType_Criterion_Police
Code written in Python version 3.10.10

This code was tailored for GO-IRAP TXT datafiles. 

Just place the GO-IRAP output TXT datafile in the same folder as the code, and run it using Python on prompt/commandline. 

If you are on Windows, do:

press the "Windows" button at the same time as the letter "r";

write "cmd" and press enter; 

find the folder where both this code and your datafile.txt are (to do that, you only need to write "cd " and the name of the directory to change to this diretcory or "cd .." to go back one level of directories, and "dir" to see what is in the current directory);

write "python policing.py" and press enter and interact with my code in the most UX-unfriendly possible way as I could not have been botered spicing up the interface yet. 

Note that this code was written under version 3.10.10 so if your Python version conflicts with it make sure you update Python or use an environment please.

An EXE *may* be comming up soon so yous don't have to run the sourcecode in Python on your prompt/commandline; yous will only need to place EXE and TXT files in the same folder and run the EXE. However, this is not done yet.

This code is offered under absolutely no warranty. Your use of this code is your responsibility.
