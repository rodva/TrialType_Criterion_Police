# TrialType_Criterion_Police

This code was tailored for GO-IRAP TXT datafiles. 
Just place the TXT datafile that GO-IRAP outputs in the same forlder as the code, and run the code on prompt/commandline using Python. 
An EXE is comming up soon so yous don't have to run in Python on prompt/commandline, yous will only need to place EXE and TXT files in the same folder and run the EXE.
Enjoy and any queries submit them to de_almeida-r at ulster ac uk.
