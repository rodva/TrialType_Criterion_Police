# TrialType_Criterion_Police
Code written in Python version 3.10.10

This code was tailored for GO-IRAP TXT datafiles. 

Place the GO-IRAP output TXT datafile in the same folder as the code, and run it using Python on prompt/commandline. 

If you are on Windows, do:

press the "Windows" button at the same time as the letter "r";

write "cmd" and press enter; 

find the folder where both this code and your datafile.txt are (to do that, you only need to write "cd " and the name of the directory to change to this diretcory or "cd .." to go back one level of directories, and "dir" to see what is in the current directory);

write "python policing.py" and press enter and interact with my code in the most UX-unfriendly possible way as I could not have been bothered spicing up the interface yet. 

Note that this code was written under Python version 3.10.10 

An HTML-based way to run another version of the code which is more interactive but does not produce all output files that the original version does eas contructed using PyScript and can be found at http://policing-irap.rd.psc.br
