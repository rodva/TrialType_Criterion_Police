# TrialType_Criterion_Police

This code was tailored for GO-IRAP TXT datafiles. 
Just place the GO-IRAP output TXT datafile in the same forlder as the code, and run it using Python on prompt/commandline. 
An EXE is comming up soon so yous don't have to run the sourcecode in Python on prompt/commandline; yous will only need to place EXE and TXT files in the same folder and run the EXE. However, this is not done yet.
This code is offered under absolutely no warranty. Your use of this code is your responsibility.
Enjoy -- any queries are to be submitted to de_almeida-r at ulster ac uk.
